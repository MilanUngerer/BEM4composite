# README

Simulation code for multigeometry composite, the geometry consist in a matrix that contain multiple inclusions, for this work we considered a polimer containing multiple ferromagnetic microwires. For more information please see "Code_instructions.ipynb"

"conector.py" is the code that take the data from "info.txt" and make a executable python code ("ejecutor.py") to solve the problem.

For use the code should fill the information in the "info.txt" script and run "run.sh".
